Please look at depends.mk.
After adjusting run make && make -C xbmc.
If configure is done you can compile from the source root directory.

KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH HARDWARE RENDERING:
=======================================

- To enable hardware layer rendering you have to set environment A10HWR=1.

- Sometimes the display engine does not initialize correctly and not all
  colors get rendered or you get pixel noise. After some video startups this
  disappears.

- Using 1080p there is a horrible screen tearing. Seems like the 
  initialization of display driver in the kernel is not correct.
  (or gles layer?)

- Not all xbmc video playback resolution settings are supported at the moment.

This problems maybe related to the mk802 3.0.36 kernel, maybe 
newer kernel versions have fixed this.

PLEASE REMEMBER: This is poc.
